# Twilight Racing

Twilight Racing is a free and open-source (GPLv3) arcade racing game, inspired by OutRun.

The game is currently a work in progress, which I'm making mainly with the goal of learning Vulkan.
I'm using Java along with LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library - https://www.lwjgl.org/).
